# react-fiber

## jsx

```jsx
const Comp = <div>this is a div comp</div>;

<Comp /> ----------------- jsx (babel 处理)

import React from 'react';

const Comp = React.createElement('div', null, 'this is a div comp');

// 17.x
// 由编译器引入（禁止自己引入！）
import {jsx as _jsx} from 'react/jsx-runtime';

function App() {
  return _jsx('div', { children: 'this is a div comp' });
}

const compFiber = {
    "type": "div",
    "key": "aaaa",
    "index": 0,
    "flags": 0,
    "tag": 5,
    "ref": null,

## Fiber

> 一个 js Object，dom 节点对应的 virtual dom（更方便、高效操作，并非一定比操作真实 dom 快）

```js
export type Fiber = {
  // These first fields are conceptually members of an Instance. This used to
  // be split into a separate type and intersected with the other Fiber fields,
  // but until Flow fixes its intersection bugs, we've merged them into a
  // single type.

  // An Instance is shared between all versions of a component. We can easily
  // break this out into a separate object to avoid copying so much to the
  // alternate versions of the tree. We put this on a single object for now to
  // minimize the number of objects created during the initial render.

  // Tag identifying the type of fiber.
  tag: WorkTag,

  // Unique identifier of this child.
  key: null | string,

  // The value of element.type which is used to preserve the identity during
  // reconciliation of this child.
  elementType: any,

  // The resolved function/class/ associated with this fiber.
  type: any,

  // The local state associated with this fiber.
  stateNode: any,

  // Conceptual aliases
  // parent : Instance -> return The parent happens to be the same as the
  // return fiber since we've merged the fiber and instance.

  // Remaining fields belong to Fiber

  // The Fiber to return to after finishing processing this one.
  // This is effectively the parent, but there can be multiple parents (two)
  // so this is only the parent of the thing we're currently processing.
  // It is conceptually the same as the return address of a stack frame.
  return: Fiber | null,

  // Singly Linked List Tree Structure.
  child: Fiber | null,
  sibling: Fiber | null,
  index: number,

  // The ref last used to attach this node.
  // I'll avoid adding an owner field for prod and model that as functions.

  // the ConcurrentMode flag indicates whether the subtree should be async-by-
  // default. When a fiber is created, it inherits the mode of its

  // This tells us how well the tree makes use of sCU for memoization.

  actualDuration?: number,

  // If the Fiber is currently active in the "render" phase,
  // This marks the time at which the work began.
